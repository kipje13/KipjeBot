# KipjeBot
Utility code for making your own rocket league bot using the [RLBot framework](https://github.com/RLBot/RLBot).  
Inspired by Chip's [RLUtilities](https://github.com/samuelpmish/RLUtilities).

### Example bots
- Aerial
- Kick-off
- Flipreset
- Controller passthrough

To run the examples you must start run.bat after launching Rocket League, then run the example bot.
